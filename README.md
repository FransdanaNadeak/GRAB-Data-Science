# GRAB Driver Safety
We compare several models to detect wether the GRAB driver is safe or not.
<br> <br> <br>
There are 3 Main Process that will be applied in this case :<br>
1. Data Preparation and Preprocessing
2. Modelling Comparison
3. Hyperparameter Tuning
4. Metrics Evaluation for the fix Model
